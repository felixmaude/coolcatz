#### You Might Be Lost
I was at the supermarket with my mom and dad at the shopping centre, before it was torn down.
I was looking at boxes of instant noodles. Somehow they were extremely interesting. I turned
around and notice that my parents weren't there. I called out for my mom, but she didn't answer 
me. They were gone. I was a lost child. What would I do? I started crying until my mom suddenly
appeared from behind the pallet that I stood in front of. Apparently, they were there the whole
time. I was just not tall enough to see over the boxes.
