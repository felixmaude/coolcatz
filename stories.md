#### The Ruler
A boy comes in to ask if he can borrow a ruler. Everybody who comes to the art classroom, not for class,
asks to borrow something or just wants to hang out. There also seems to be an assumption that an art 
class room has _everything_. We have many things, but **we do not have everything**. Back to the story...
The teacher asks, "How long"? The boy looks at the clock, looks back at us and says, "For around 30 minutes
or so". There seems to be a misinterpretation. I say to him, "No. She meant how long of a ruler do you want"?
There is a roar of laughter, the good kind. It was a comical moment for all of us. In the end, I think he 
wanted a normal 30 cm ruler. He eventually did return it 30 minutes later, maybe earlier. It was a good day.
