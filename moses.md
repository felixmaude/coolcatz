#### "Moses" W  

Moses is a DHS, domestic short hair. He is also a black cat, which helps him blend into the surroundings of a dark room or a black chair.
Because of his ability to camouflage, it makes it more fun and interesting to find him. In the instances that I have searched for him, he
was either sniffing to learn his environment or he notices that you are looking for him and he makes a face. I assume his face is saying,
"Are you looking for me"? or "Yes"? 

Recently, his curiosity led to his demise. Like magic, he jumped (floated) onto the kitchen stove and burned his paw. He grilled his foot
on a george foreman grill (he didn't, that's a joke). Unfortunately, I wasn't physically there to witness this. His owners were. I just 
happened to be facetiming my sister as this occured. It happened like this. _We are talking._ *OH MY GOSH!* Done. That's the story. His 
owners brought him to an emergency veterinary clinc and returned with a cone on his head and some painkillers. He would later be brought 
to another clinc and be presribed an antibiotic ointment(?). The burn created a limping Moses, a slow Moses, and a tired Moses. Some of 
these effects were brought on by the pain killers he was taking. It has been a few weeks now and his foot his healing well. He is no longer 
lethargic. He is now Moses.
