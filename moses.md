#### "Moses" W

Moses is a DHS, domestic short hair. He is also a black cat, which helps him blend into the surroundings of a dark room or a black chair.
Because of his ability to camouflage, it makes it more fun and interesting to find him. In the instances that I have searched for him, he
was either sniffing to learn his environment or he notices that you are looking for him and he makes a face. I assume his face is saying,
"Are you looking for me"? or "Yes"?
