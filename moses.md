#### "Moses" W  



Moses is a DSH, domestic short hair. He is also a black cat, which helps him blend into the surroundings of a dark room or a black chair.
Because of his ability to camouflage, it makes it more fun and interesting to find him. In the instances that I have searched for him, he
was either sniffing to learn his environment or he notices that you are looking for him and he makes a face. _Are you looking for me?_

Recently, his curiosity led to his demise. Like magic, he jumped (floated) onto the kitchen stove and burned his paw. He grilled his foot
on a george foreman grill (he didn't, that's a joke). Unfortunately, I wasn't physically there to witness this. His owners were. However, 
I just happened to be facetiming them when this occurred. It happened like this. _We are talking._ **OH MY GOSH!**   

Done. That's the story.  

His owners brought him to an emergency veterinary clinic and returned with a cone on his head and some painkillers. I think he would have 
also returned with some helium balloons attached to him, due to a stressed owner worrying about the condition of his foot. It was believed 
that using helium balloons, it would help alleviate the pressure he was applying to the burned foot. Luckily, the idea was dismissed. A few 
days later, Moses was brought to another clinic and presribed an antibiotic ointment(?). His murdern mittens were also trimmed. Good for me, 
but maybe not so happy for the cat. The burn created a limping Moses, a slow Moses, and a tired Moses. Some of these effects were brought on 
by the painkillers he was taking. It has been a few weeks now and his foot is healing well. He is no longer lethargic. He is now Moses.  

You may ask, "What does it mean to be a Moses"? To be a Moses means to live on the edge, to live wild, to live rent free. For instance, every 
Sunday, Moses partakes in the _hardcore parkour_ on the stairs. He balances on the ledge of the stairs, weaving through the stair posts. On a 
normal day, being a Moses includes short, bursted _meows_ while climbing up the castle, some feisty repetitive kicks to your foot, or a game 
of hide and seek (I have won a few games). Finally, to be a Moses everyday is to feed yourself, clean yourself, and do your bitness. All done 
in a timely manner.
