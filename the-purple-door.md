#### The Purple Door
During my first year of university, the school was building a new extension to the main campus. It
would hold studio spaces for the wood, plastic and metal shops, the rapid protyping centre, as far
as I can remember. With my friends, the three of us decided to explore the new wing in our free time.
We were waiting for our next classes to start. The concete floors were still dusty from renovation. 
The studio spaces were not completely ready for use yet. A work in progress. We walked down a hallway 
that led us to a purple door. Our school was decorated this way, where certain colours were set for 
certain doors. It indicated where in the building you were. We walked through and took a glimpse. 
There was nothing special. It was a stairwell after all. We turned around to leave. I tried to open
the same door we entered. It wouldn't open. **NO WAY. NO WAY. NO WAY.** I was in complete disbelief. For 
a brief moment, I thought we would be stuck there forever. Maybe they felt the same too. We weren't. 
We walked up the stairs and left from another door.
