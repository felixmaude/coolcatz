#### Street Vomit

Vomiting is an experience. It's not great, but it happens whether you like it or not. On this day,
my mom and I took the bus to visit my grandma at the hospital. She had another lung infection. We 
got off the nearest stop and walked the rest of the way. As we were walking, I felt the beginning
of the end. It was like a roller coaster that was slowly inching towards the drop. **BARF!** It
came right out of my mouth and landed on the ground. All of this happened while a man walked past
us. I asked my mom, "Don't we need to clean it up"? She said, "No". We left and kept walking, 
leaving my vomit in the centre of the side walk.
